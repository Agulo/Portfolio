      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a developer with a current focus on Java and flutter while staring to touch on frameworks, I've 
          used HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL and C++ as these are thing that I leared in my years as a 
          Information Technology student in Richfield College. Ive worked with Firebase as a backend when 
          a login in and sign-up ended up working for a flutter app. My background is that I have stared really
          programming in high school with a subject called Computer Application Technology (CAT) and from 
          there seeing how HTML and CSS work making things the way I want got me interested in programming.
